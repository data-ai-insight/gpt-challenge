Now that the XZ backdoor has control over sshd, attackers can possess the encryption key used to make the SSH connections hide their malicious code in the SSH login certificate and use it as an entry point to execute various malicious actions on the compromised device - such as stealing files or installing malware (e.g., ransomware ... Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, \"it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,\" Will Dormann, a ... The story of the XZ backdoor's discovery starts in the early morning of March 29th, as San Francisco-based Microsoft developer Andres Freund posted on Mastodon and sent an email to OpenWall's ... On March 28, 2024 a backdoor was identified in XZ Utils. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-3094 with a CVSS score of 10 is a result of a software supply chain compromise impacting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended organizations to downgrade to a previous non-compromised XZ Utils version.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe XZ backdoor refers to malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, which manipulated the sshd executable file used for remote connections.
